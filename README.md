# Brainiac App
This is the code for the Brainiac App. This is a gamified study app. That takes advantage of the forgetting curve to make sure you get maximum returns for the least time studying. 

# Status
Basic functionality seems to work. Though testing was about the weaker end of 3 days. There are a few known mobile bugs like bad keyboard integration among other things. Also the settings tab, and sharing of course content are features that we are looking to add at some point in the future
